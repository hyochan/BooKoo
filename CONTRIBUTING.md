## Pull request(PR)

PR is available to `main` branch.

Each PR should correspond to one idea and implement it coherently. This idea may be a feature that spans several parts of the codebase. For example, changing an API may include changes to the Android, iOS, and web implementations, the JavaScript SDK, and the docs for the API.

Generally, each PR should contain one commit that is amended as you address code review feedback. Each commit should be meaningful and make sense on its own. Similarly, it should be easy to revert each commit. This keeps the commit history easier to read when people are working on this code or searching for a commit that could have broken something.

## Coding Guidelines

Please read brief description in [hyochan/style-guide/React](https://github.com/hyochan/style-guide/blob/main/docs/REACT.md).
Most of the style guide would be enforced by ESLint and Prettier.
