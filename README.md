`BooKoo` is a shared household accounting app developed in 2017. Due to limited resources for maintenance, the project was discontinued in 2019. However, lingering interest in the project has led to its revival as a community-based toy project for knowledge sharing. This new development will be conducted as an open-source project, utilizing Supabase for the backend.
